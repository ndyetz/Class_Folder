TITLE: 		Outputting Discrepancy Matrix; 
DATA: 	FILE IS lab_9_cor.txt; 
		TYPE IS CORRELATION; 
		NOBSERVATIONS IS 250; 
VARIABLE: NAMES ARE item1-item6;
MODEL:  	factor1 BY item1* (L1) !Don't use analysis statement in when runnign CFA
       		item2-item6 (L2-L6); !item1* is saying, fix the first item at the factor 1.
        	item1-item6 (U1-U6); !(UI-U6) = label. You can refer to them later. 
       		factor1@1;    !@1 fixes the factor variance at 1. if you want to fix it at the mean do [mean]
MODEL CONSTRAINT: !MODEL CONSTRAINT = create equations in R
 			NEW(OMEGA); !Create new variable
        			OMEGA = (L1+L2+L3+L4+L5+L6)**2/ !Omega = sum of loadings^2 / sum of loadings plus sum of uniquenesses
        			((L1+L2+L3+L4+L5+L6)**2+U1+U2+U3+U4+U5+U6); !Equation for new variable.
OUTPUT: STANDARDIZED RESIDUAL;
