TITLE: 		CFA of Lab 9 Example Data; 
DATA: 		FILE IS Lab 9 Data_M.csv; 
VARIABLE: 	NAMES ARE item1-item6; 
MODEL:  	factor1 BY item1* (L1) !Don't use analysis statement in when runnign CFA
       		item2-item6 (L2-L6); !item1* is saying, fix the first item at the factor 1.
        	item1-item6 (U1-U6); !(UI-U6) = label. You can refer to them later. 
       		factor1@1;    !@1 fixes the factor variance at 1. if you want to fix it at the mean do [mean]
MODEL CONSTRAINT: !MODEL CONSTRAINT = create equations in R
 			NEW(OMEGA); !Create new variable
        			OMEGA = (L1+L2+L3+L4+L5+L6)**2/ !Omega = sum of loadings^2 / sum of loadings plus sum of uniquenesses
        			((L1+L2+L3+L4+L5+L6)**2+U1+U2+U3+U4+U5+U6); !Equation for new variable.

OUTPUT:     STANDARDIZED; CINTERVAL; !Standardize factors, give me the confidence interval.

!"BY" indicates a "bidirectional relationship.
