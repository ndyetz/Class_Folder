####Fit a 3-way interaction to determine if the hygiene*anxiety effect is significantly different by sex.
```{r}

slp_3way <- slp %>%
    mutate(anxiety_m = anxiety - mean(anxiety),
           hygiene_m = hygiene - mean(hygiene))

mod3way <- lm(data = slp_3way, sleep ~ hygiene_m + anxiety_m + female + hygiene_m*anxiety_m + hygiene_m*female + anxiety_m*female + hygiene_m*anxiety_m*female)

ols_regress(mod3way)

sd(slp_3way$anxiety_m)


```


####Plot the results of the 3-way Interaction
```{r}
#install.packages("cowplot")
library(cowplot)

threeway.jn <- lm(data=slp_3way, sleep ~ hygiene*anxiety*female.f)

probe_interaction(threeway.jn, pred = hygiene, modx = anxiety, mod2 = female.f, 
                  jnplot = TRUE,
                  x.label = "Sleep Hygiene",
                  y.label = "Sleep Efficiency",
                  main.title = "Differential effect of hygiene on sleep efficiency by anxiety", 
                  legend.main = "Level of Anxiety")



```
