#Dataset description 

research team is interested
in assessing the relationship
between caloric deficit and
pounds lost over the course of
a 1 month weight loss
program designed for men
age 40 to 50 in CO. 100
obese men were randomly
selected to participate. The
team measured the following
variables:

#Variable description

1. <u>OUTCOME</u>: **lbslost** = pounds lost
after one month on the
weight loss program
2. **caldeff** = caloric deficit
over the course of the
program (expressed in
1000 calories). A caloric
deficit is a state in which
you are burning more
calories than you eat.
3. **selfeff** = self efficacy for
weight loss at the start of
the program

# Load libraries
```{r, message = FALSE}

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) 


#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("descriptr")
#install.packages("mosaic")

library(tidyverse)
library(descriptr)
library(mosaic)

```

# Import data
```{r, message = FALSE}

wtloss <- read_csv(file = "wtloss.csv")

screener(wtloss)
#"screener()" gives gives a quick look at your data

```


# Explore the sample data
## Get descriptive statistics for lbslost (pounds lost)
```{r}

summary_stats(wtloss$lbslost)

#NOTE: A NEGATIVE VALUE IN LBSLOST = THEY GAINED WEIGHT!!!!

```

## Make a histogram of lbslost
### Start by marking +/- 2 SDs from mean
```{r}

mean(wtloss$lbslost) - 2*sd(wtloss$lbslost)
mean(wtloss$lbslost) + 2*sd(wtloss$lbslost)


ggplot(wtloss, aes(x = lbslost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) + 2*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) - 2*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pounds lost for the 100 men in the study",
       subtitle = "red line represents sample mean, blue lines represents +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean",
       x = "pounds lost") 
  
```

### Repeat the histogram, but exchange 2 for 1.96, the more precise estimate of t-scores

```{r}

qnorm(c(.025, .975))

```

The below graph is a more precise version of the above graph

```{r}

ggplot(wtloss, aes(x = lbslost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) + 1.959964*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) - 1.959964*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pounds lost for the 100 men in the study",
       subtitle = "red line represents sample mean, blue lines represents +/- 1.96 standard deviations from the mean",
       x = "pounds lost") 
  
```

### Repeat the histogram, but now make use of the Student's t-distribution instead of the z-distribution

qt = the same name as qnorm, but it uses the t-distribution!!!
```{r}

qt(c(.025, .975), df = 99) #99 is our df because it's n-1! (our sample size = 100 in the weight loss study)

```

Instead of 1.96, we use "1.98" because we are working with the t-distribution!!
```{r}

ggplot(wtloss, aes(x = lbslost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) + 1.984217*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost) - 1.984217*sd(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pounds lost for the 100 men in the study",
       subtitle = "red line represents sample mean, blue lines represents +/- 1.98 standard deviations from the mean",
       x = "pounds lost") 
  
```

# Consider the hypothetical population
## Simulate a population
```{r}

# generate some data
set.seed(8642) #<- REMEMEBER the number (8642) is just a random number, it really doesn't matter what you put in here.... but you need something!
p_lbslost <- rnorm(n=50000, m=3.00, sd=2.00) #set what parameters you want
my_pop <- data.frame(p_lbslost) #Just put into a dataframe

# plot the normal distribution
ggplot(my_pop, aes(x = p_lbslost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) +
  labs(title = "Pounds lost following a weight loss program", subtitle = "simulation of a population", x = "pounds lost")

```

## Randomly select 3 samples of size 100 from the my_pop population
```{r}

set.seed(19657)
s1 <- sample_n(my_pop, 100, replace = TRUE) #We are choosing a smaple of 100 people in the population dataframe we just created
s2 <- sample_n(my_pop, 100, replace = TRUE) #replace = TRUE says if we rechoose someone, replace their value
s3 <- sample_n(my_pop, 100, replace = TRUE)

my_samples <- bind_rows(s1, s2, s3, .id='sample')  #.id = says create a column to name how we want these to designaated (it just creates a new variable and the value is a unique value associated with the vector it was taken from)

my_samples %>% 
  group_by(sample) %>% 
  summarize(mean_in_sample = mean(p_lbslost)) 

```

## Plot the distribution of pounds lost in each of the samples
```{r}

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x = p_lbslost, group = sample, fill = sample)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Pounds lost following a weight loss program in the three samples", x = "pounds lost")

```


## Create a repeated sampling function
```{r}

#Kim created this function!!! It is creating the ability to sample in a population!

rep_sample_n <- function(tbl, size, replace = FALSE, reps = 1)
{
    n <- nrow(tbl)
    i <- unlist(replicate(reps, sample.int(n, size, replace = replace), simplify = FALSE))

    rep_tbl <- cbind(replicate = rep(1:reps,rep(size,reps)), tbl[i, , drop=FALSE])

    dplyr::group_by(rep_tbl, replicate)
}

```


## Draw 10000 random samples and obtain the mean and standard deviation in each one
### Start with a sample size equal to the wtloss dataframe (100 men per sample)
#### Generate the samples
```{r}

set.seed(47256)
sample_means <- my_pop %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 10000, replace = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(mean_lbslost = mean(p_lbslost), sd_lbslost = sd(p_lbslost))

# print mean and standard deviation of average pounds lost
mean(sample_means$mean_lbslost)
sd(sample_means$mean_lbslost)
  
```


#### Plot the average pounds lost in each of the 10000 random samples of size 100
```{r}

ggplot(sample_means, aes(x = mean_lbslost)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample_means$mean_lbslost), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  labs(title = "Average pounds lost across 10000 samples",
       subtitle = "red line represents the mean of all sample means", x = "average pounds lost in the sample") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 5))


```

#### Calculate the number of samples that have a mean outside +/- 1.98 standard deviations from the mean
```{r}

me <- 1.984217*0.2002739 # margin of error
lower <- 2.985371 - (1.984217*0.2002739) # lower bound of confidence limit
upper <- 2.985371 + (1.984217*0.2002739) # upper bound of confidence limit
me 
lower 
upper

sample_means <- sample_means %>% 
  mutate(out_range = ifelse(mean_lbslost < lower | mean_lbslost > upper, 1, 0))

mean(sample_means$out_range)

# add 95% confidence band to our histogram
ggplot(sample_means, aes(x = mean_lbslost)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample_means$mean_lbslost), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lower, lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = upper, lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  labs(title = "Average pounds lost across 10000 samples",
       subtitle = "red line represents the mean of all sample means, blue line represents +/- 1.98 SEs from this mean",
       x = "average pounds lost in the sample") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 5))

# remove these temporary quantities
rm(me, lower, upper)


#[1] 0.3973869
#[1] 2.587984
#[1] 3.382758
#[1] 0.0475 <- Proportion of samples outside of our +/1 1.98 SEs
```

### Explore what happens when we change the sample size
```{r}

samp.size <- 25

explore <- my_pop %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = samp.size, reps = 10000, replace = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(mean_lbslost = mean(p_lbslost), sd_lbslost = sd(p_lbslost))

# print mean and standard deviation of average pounds lost
mean(explore$mean_lbslost)
sd(explore$mean_lbslost)

ggplot(explore, aes(x = mean_lbslost)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1) +
  labs(title = "Average pounds lost across 10000 samples") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 5))

```


## Return to our sample -- recreate the histogram but add the standard error of the mean
### Calculate the t-scores of the t-distribution that corresponds with the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles given our df
```{r}

qt(c(.025, .975), df = 99)

```

### Calculate the 95% confidence interval 
```{r}

# calculate a store relevant quantitees
mean <- mean(wtloss$lbslost) # mean in the sample
sd <- sd(wtloss$lbslost) # standard deviation in the sample
n <- length(wtloss$lbslost) # n of the sample

se <- sd/sqrt(n) # standard error
se

me <- 1.984217*se # 95% confidence interval
me

lower <- mean - me # calculate lower bound for confidence interval
upper <- mean + me # calculate upper bound for confidence interval
lower 
upper

```


### Add the standard errors to the histogram
```{r}

ggplot(wtloss, aes(x = lbslost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean, lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lower, lwd = 2, color="green") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = upper, lwd = 2, color="green") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pounds lost for the 100 men in the study",
       subtitle = "red line represents sample mean \ngreen lines represent +/- 1.98 standard errors from the mean",
       x = "pounds lost") 

# remove these temporary quantities
rm(me, lower, upper)
  
```

### Synthesize by calculating 95% CI for all 10,000 samples
```{r}


sample_means <- sample_means %>% 
  select(replicate, mean_lbslost, sd_lbslost) %>% 
  mutate(se = sd_lbslost/sqrt(99),
         me = 1.984217*se,
         lower = mean_lbslost - me,
         upper = mean_lbslost + me,
         not_in_ci = ifelse(2.985371 < lower | 2.985371 > upper, 1, 0))

mean(sample_means$not_in_ci) #mean of individuals not in our 95% CI. Hey look it's .046 that's about 5%!!!

```


### Explore t-scores given alpha
```{r}

# t-scores needed for a 95% CI
# score for a two-tailed test with alpha = .05, df = 99 (equivalent ways to write)
qt(1-.05/2, df = 99)
qt(c(.025, .975), df = 99)

# t-scores needed for a 99% CI
# t-score for a two-tailed test with alpha = .01, df = 99 (equivalent ways to write)
qt(1-.01/2, df = 99)
qt(c(.005, .995), df = 99)


```

### Calculate a 99% CI
```{r}

me <- 2.626405*se # 99% confidence interval
me

lower <- mean - me # calculate lower bound for confidence interval
upper <- mean + me # calculate upper bound for confidence interval
lower 
upper

# remove these temporary quantities
rm(me, lower, upper)

```



# Hypothesis testing -- is the average pounds lost significantly different than 0?
## Simulate a population where the mean pounds lost is 0 (null hypothesis)
```{r}

set.seed(94965)
p_lbslost0 <- rnorm(n=50000, m=0, sd=2.00)
my_pop0 <- data.frame(p_lbslost0)

sample_means0 <- my_pop0 %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 10000, replace = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(mean_lbslost0 = mean(p_lbslost0), sd_lbslost0 = sd(p_lbslost0))

ggplot(sample_means0, aes(x = mean_lbslost0)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample_means0$mean_lbslost0), lwd = 2, color="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample_means0$mean_lbslost0) + 1.984*sd(sample_means0$mean_lbslost0), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample_means0$mean_lbslost0) - 1.984*sd(sample_means0$mean_lbslost0), lwd = 2, color="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wtloss$lbslost), lwd = 2, color = "green") +
  labs(title = "Average pounds lost across 10000 samples under the null hypothesis",
       subtitle = "red line represents the mean of all sample means \nblue line represents +/- 1.984 SEs from this mean \ngreen line represents the observed pounds lost in our sample",
       x = "average pounds lost in the sample") 


```

## What is the probability of obtaining our sample mean if the null hypothesis is true?
```{r}

2*(pt(14.6, 99, lower.tail = FALSE)) #we have to multiply this value by two BECAUSE we are doing a two-tailed test!!!!

#99 = degrees of freedome 

```


## Perform a one-sample t-test
```{r}
# Calculate the critical value of t given alpha and df
qt(1-.05/2, df = 99)
qt(c(.025, .975), df = 99)

# Conduct t-test
t.test (wtloss$lbslost, mu=0, conf.level = .95)

# Calculate the p-value
2*(pt(14.601, df = 99, lower.tail =FALSE))


#t* always equals the critical t in Kim's class!

```
