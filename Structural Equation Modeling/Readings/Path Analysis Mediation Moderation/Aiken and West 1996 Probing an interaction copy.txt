Aiken & West 1996 Probing an Interaction

Y = b1X + b2Z + b3XZ + b0

if interaction is significant follow these steps:

1. create 3 new variables ZcvU = Z - CVz1, ZcvM = Z - CVzM, ZcvL = CVz_1; where CVz1 = value of Z at +1 SD, CVzM = mean of Z, CVZ_1 = Value of Z at -1 SD

2. Create XZcvU, XZcvM, XZcvL the new interaction terms

3. y = b1X + b2ZcvU + b3XZcvU + b0, y = b1X + b2ZcvM + b3XZcvM + b0, y = b1X + b2ZcvL + b3XZcvL + b0

Notes: 	

b1 will be the simple slope of Y on X at Z = cvU, cvM, or cvL respectively - test will be if the simple slope differs from 0
	
b0 will be the intercept of Y on X at Z = cvU, cvM, or cvL respectively

Test if slopes are different from one another
t = d/Sd; d = difference in the slopes
t = ((ZH - ZL)b3)/(sqrt((Zh-Zl)^2)) = b3/sqrt(s33) = 
***this means that if b3 was significant in the original analysis than the simple slopes differ - no further test is necessary (Aiken & West, 1996, p. 21)***
