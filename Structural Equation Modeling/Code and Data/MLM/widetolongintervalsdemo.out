SUMMARY OF DATA

     Number of clusters                         33

       Size (s)    Cluster ID with Size s

     A MATRIX COULD NOT BE INVERTED DURING THE H1 MODEL ESTIMATION.
     THE ESTIMATED WITHIN COVARIANCE MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE AS IT
     SHOULD BE.  COMPUTATION COULD NOT BE COMPLETED.
     THE VARIANCE OF INTERVEN APPROACHES 0.  FIX THIS VARIANCE AND THE
     CORRESPONDING COVARIANCES TO 0, DECREASE THE MINIMUM VARIANCE, OR
     SPECIFY THE VARIABLE AS A BETWEEN VARIABLE.

     THE H1 MODEL ESTIMATION DID NOT CONVERGE.  THE SAMPLE STATISTICS COULD NOT
     BE COMPUTED.




RESULTS FOR BASIC ANALYSIS

NOTE:  The sample statistics for within and between refer to the
       maximum-likelihood estimated within and between covariance
       matrices, respectively.
